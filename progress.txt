## Session Start

- SQLite for user storage (simple, file-based)
- Pydantic for all data models

### Known Challenges
- Rutracker may require proxy/VPN from some regions
- Trakt tokens expire every 24 hours - need auto-refresh
- sendMessageDraft is new Telegram API - verify support in python-telegram-bot
