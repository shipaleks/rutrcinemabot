# Media Concierge Bot - Progress Log

This file tracks learnings, decisions, and blockers across Ralph iterations.
Each entry should be timestamped and reference the story ID.

---

## Session Start

Project initialized. Ready for first iteration.

### Decisions Made
- Using python-telegram-bot 21.x (async)
- Using Claude claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 for tool_use
- SQLite for user storage (simple, file-based)
- Pydantic for all data models

### Known Challenges
- Rutracker may require proxy/VPN from some regions
- Trakt tokens expire every 24 hours - need auto-refresh
- sendMessageDraft is new Telegram API - verify support in python-telegram-bot

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1 - INFRA-001: Project Structure Setup
**Date:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

#### What was done:
- Created `pyproject.toml` with all required dependencies:
  - python-telegram-bot 21.x for async Telegram bot
  - anthropic 0.40+ for Claude API
  - httpx, pydantic, structlog, aiosqlite, cryptography, beautifulsoup4, lxml
  - Dev dependencies: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy
- Created multi-stage `Dockerfile` optimized for production:
  - Builder stage with compilation dependencies
  - Runtime stage with minimal image size (target < 500MB)
  - Health check endpoint configured
  - Non-root user for security
  - Supports webhook mode for Koyeb deployment
- Verified all acceptance criteria:
  - ✅ Directory structure exists (src/, tests/, data/, docs/)
  - ✅ pyproject.toml with all dependencies
  - ✅ .env.example with all environment variables
  - ✅ .gitignore for Python project
  - ✅ Dockerfile for Koyeb
  - ✅ README.md with project description

#### Learnings:
- Project structure was already partially set up, needed pyproject.toml and Dockerfile
- Using ruff for linting/formatting (modern, fast alternative to black + flake8)
- Dockerfile uses multi-stage build to minimize final image size
- All async dependencies selected for python-telegram-bot 21.x compatibility

#### Next steps:
- INFRA-002: Configuration Management (src/config.py with pydantic-settings)
